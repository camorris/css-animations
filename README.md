# Creative Brief: CSS-Animations

"Even though I worked hard at times, it was always magical. I have to confess I enjoued every minute of it. Even the down times I enjoyed, because we were creating something that would make people smile and lift their hearts. You cant think of a better job than that." - Floyd Norman

# Project Summary

This document serves to explain why I created files showcasing  CSS-Animations. It is my goal to help recruiters and/or employers get an idea of how I like to exercise my creativity. 

## Project Objective

This project was created with the help of Val Head, Design Evangelist at Adobe and author of Designing Interface Animation. I felt I needed to take this course in order to grow my understanding of how to use CSS. The project is simply HTML and CSS files that can be cloned or downloaded to your local computer in order to see animations I created. Most importantly, this project will give recruiters an understanding that the skills I developed in this project will help simplify the handoff to the development team. 

### Targeted Audience

For the purpose of working with a company I am targeting those individuals with the title Recruiter, Hiring Manager, and/or Founder.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
